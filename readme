# Image Optimization Script

This Python script optimizes images in a directory by resizing them (optional) and reducing their file size to a specified limit.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   Pillow (PIL) library: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup

1.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2.  Activate the virtual environment:
    -   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    -   On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3.  Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

1.  Run the script from the command line: `python image_optimizer.py`
2.  The script will prompt you for the following inputs:

    -   **Images Directory Source Path:** The path to the directory containing the images you want to optimize.
    -   **Images Directory Output Path:** The path to the directory where the optimized images will be saved.
    -   **Desired Output File Format:** The desired file format for the optimized images (e.g., jpg, png).
    -   **Desired Width for all Images (Optional):**  Enter a width to resize all images to that width. Leave blank to keep original width.
    -   **Desired Size in KB for all Images (Optional, default 100kb):** The maximum file size in KB for the optimized images. Leave blank to default to 100kb.

The script will then process each image in the input directory, resize it if a desired width is provided, and reduce its quality until it meets the specified size limit. The optimized images will be saved in the output directory with the specified file format.
